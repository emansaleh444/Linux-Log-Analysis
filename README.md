🚀 Linux Log Analysis Project
📌 Project Overview

This project simulates a real-world Data Engineering workflow using Linux command-line tools.
The dataset used is the NASA July 1995 web server access log.

The goal was to explore, analyze, and automate log processing using Bash scripting.

📊 Analysis Performed

Total number of log entries

File size inspection

Top 10 IP addresses

Most requested URLs

Number of requests per IP

Total error requests (4xx & 5xx)

Error rate percentage

Peak traffic hour

Suspicious IP detection

⚙️ Automation
