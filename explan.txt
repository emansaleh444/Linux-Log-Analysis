in this project  i download a nasa log dataset using ftp from th terminal
i extractt the compressed file and inspect its structur using linux tools
i analyzed the dataset using commands such as wc head tail awk sort and uniq
i identified the log structure including ip address timestamp url status code and respond size
i calculate total rows file size and extracted top 10 ip
i analyzed most requested url and detected error responses 4xx and 5xx
i calculate error rate and peak traffic hour
i detected suspicious ip based on high number of requests
finally i automated analysis using a bash script that accepts the log file as input the script generate a structured report automatically
this project simulates real world data engineering log analysis tasks
